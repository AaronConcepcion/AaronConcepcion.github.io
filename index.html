			<h1>A Dog's Purpose</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				<p>Dogs are sometimes referred to as "man's best friend" because they are kept as domestic pets and are usually loyal and like being around humans.
				There are at least 800 breeds (kinds) of dogs. Dogs whose parents were the same breed will also be that breed: these dogs are called purebred or pure pedigree dogs. Dogs with parents from different breeds no longer belong to one breed: they are called mutts, mixed-breed dogs, hybrids, or mongrels. Some of the most popular breeds are sheepdogs, collies, poodles and retrievers. It is becoming popular to breed together two different breeds of dogs and call the new dog's breed a name that is a mixture of the parents' breeds' two names. A puppy with a poodle and a pomeranian as parents might be called a Pomapoo. These kinds of dogs, instead of being called mutts, are known as designer dog breeds. These dogs are normally used for prize shows and designer shows. They can be guide dogs.</p>

				<h1>DID YOU KNOW</h1>

			<div class="didyouknow">
				<p> 1. A dog’s nose print is unique, much like a person’s fingerprint.</p>
				<p>	2. Speaking of sleeping … all dogs dream, but puppies and senior dogs dream more frequently than adult dogs.</p>
				<p>	3. A dog’s sense of smell is legendary, but did you know that his nose has as many as 300 million receptors? In comparison, a human nose has about 5 million.</p>
				<p>	4. The shape of a dog’s face suggests its longevity: A long face means a longer life.</p>
				<p>	5. Dog eyes have a part called the tapetum lucidum, allowing night vision.</p>
				<p>	6. The Australian Shepherd is not actually from Australia—they are an American breed.</p>
				<p>	7. … And the Labrador Retriever is originally from Newfoundland.</p>
				<p>	8. Human blood pressure goes down when petting a dog. And so does the dog’s.</p>
				<p>	9. Dogs are not colorblind. They also see blue and yellow.</p>
				<p>	10. All puppies are born deaf.</p>
				<p>	11. Dogs have about 1,700 taste buds. (We humans have between 2,000–10,000.)</p>
