      <h1>TOP FIVE DOG BREEDS</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="breed">
      <div class="text1">
        <h1>Labrador Retriever</h1>
        <p>Labrador Retrievers, or ‘Labs’ as they are lovingly known, are the quintessential family dog, which is why they’ve held top spot on the AKC dog breed list for 19 years in a row!</p>
        <p>These traits make them popular as working dogs too. Seeing-eye/assistance dogs, search and rescue dogs, detection dogs and more are regularly Labs. They’re movie stars too – did you see the recent hit Marley & Me?</p>
        <p>The popularity of Labs as a family pet comes from their mellow temperament, loyalty, intelligence, and gentle nature with kids.</p>
        <p>Originally from Newfoundland, Labs come in three different colors: yellow, black, and chocolate (brown). They can also be a red color, called ‘fox-red’, which is technically still a yellow lab.</p>

      <div class="text2">
        <h1>German Shepherd</h1>
        <p>German Shepherds have long been popular dogs, and were even the #1 dog breed throughout the 1920s, reportedly due to their starring roles in Hollywood (as characters such as Rin Tin Tin). Bred as herding dogs, they originated in the 19th century – in Germany, of course!</p>
        <p>They are large-sized dogs, most commonly tan & black or red & black varieties. They are known for their loyalty and protective nature, which makes them an ideal choice for a family pet.</p>
        <p>German Shepherds are considered the third-smartest dog breed, behind Border Collies and Poodles. Due to their high intelligence, they are also the number one choice for police, guard, and military dogs in the world.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text1">
        <h1>Yorkshire Terrier</h1>
        <p>Celebrities often carry pet Yorkies around in their purses, contributing to their popularity! Famous fans include: Britney Spears, Tara Reid, Venus Williams, Kelly Rowland, and even Joan Rivers.</p>
        <p>Yorkies originate from Yorkshire, England. They have glossy, straight hair and are black and tan in color. Intelligent, attention-loving dogs, they’re affectionate and protective to their owners. While these ‘toy’ dogs don’t intimidate with their size, they have a ferocious bark to make up for it! They’re also known for their bravery – one Yorkie named Smoky fought in 12 combat missions and won eight battle stars for her service in the US Air Force.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text2">
        <h1>Golden Retriever</h1>
        <p>Many people believe Golden Retrievers are part of the Labrador Retrievers breed. It’s easy to see why: like Labs, Golden Retrievers are dogs bred originally for retrieving that make great family pets due to their friendly temperament. They’re a similar color too.</p>
        <p>But Golden Retrievers are a completely separate breed, with different origins (they’re from Scotland!), a stockier build and a longer, shaggier coat.</p>
        <p>Golden Retrievers are a good breed for agility and obedience training. They are too friendly to be guard dogs, but their intelligence makes them well-suited for search and rescue. These sweet dogs are even used by zoos as surrogate mothers to babies of different species, due to their kind, nurturing temperament.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text1">
        <h1>Beagle</h1>
        <p>Beagles are small-to-medium sized dogs that were developed as scent hounds for hunting. Beagle-type dogs have had a long history in literature and art, and have been favorite dogs of royalty. But no beagle can compare to the most famous one of all: Snoopy!</p>
        <p>Beagles are popular as pets because they have a ‘merry’ temperament and enjoy spending time with their family. In the working world, they are often used as detection dogs in airports, sniffing out contraband food and other items in luggage.</p>
